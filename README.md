# What is this Auto EDA Script?

Auto EDA Script is an automated data analysis tool . This auto EDA script will analyze your dataset and present it in report form with just one click.

You just need to input a csv\xlsx file dataset, the script will

read the data
identify and treat missing values ​​
detect and remove outliers
visualize categorical and numeric columns
encode

Great features of the script

CSV/Excel  file input
Dataset Information ( like :  dataset shape, type, size ,  columns , duplicated values)
Separate Columns ( Categorical and Numerical)
Finding Missing Value (with chart\plot)
Dataset descriptive statistics (all numeric columns defined median, mode, IQR)
Clean Dataset ( Missing and Duplicates value Treatment)
Outlier detection and handling (with chart\plot)
Categorical Columns Analysis  (with chart\plot)
Numerical Columns Analysis   (with chart\plot)
Correlation Matrix  (with chart\plot)
Feature Engineering 
Encoding (Label / One-Hot)
And finally, download the clean data set.

How does it work? (Step by Step)

Give the path of the dataset (Dataset should be in  CSV/Excel file format) 
The script will give you options – how to handle missing values ('fill' or 'drop')
Do you want to do Feature Engineering? Give (yes/no)
If there are outliers, it will ask if you want to remove them or not.? (yes/no)
Do you want to apply encoding?? Give (yes/no)
Then the script will analyze and create charts/plots.
And finally, it will ask you for the name of the dataset.
